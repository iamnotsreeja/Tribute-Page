                About the Legend
            </h1>
            <p>
            William Henry Gates III was born in Seattle, Washington on October 28, 1955.
            He was the middle child of William H. Gates II, a prominent Seattle lawyer, and Mary Gates,
            who worked as a teacher before she had kids. Bill had an older sister,
            Kristi, and a younger sister, Libby.<br><br>
                   
            Bill loved to play board games and was competitive at most everything he did.
            He was an intelligent student and his best subject in grade school was math.
            However, Bill got easily bored with school and ended up getting into trouble a lot.
             His parents kept him occupied with outside activities like Boy Scouts 
            (he earned his Eagle Scout badge) and reading science fiction books.<br><br>

            When Bill turned thirteen his parents sent him to the Lakeside 
            Preparatory School hoping it would prove more of a challenge for him.
            It was at Lakeside where Bill met his future business partner Paul Allen.
            He also was introduced to computers at Lakeside<br><br>

            In 1975, Gates dropped out of Harvard to start a software company with Paul
            Allen called Microsoft. 
            The company was doing well, but it was in 1980 that Gates made a deal 
            with IBM that would change computing. Microsoft reached a deal to provide
            the MS-DOS operating system on the new IBM PC. Gates sold the software to IBM 
            for a fee of $50,000, however he held onto the copyright of the software. 
            When the PC market took off, Microsoft also sold MS-DOS to other PC manufacturers. 
            Soon, Microsoft was the operating system in a large percentage of 
            computers around the world.<br><br>

            In 1985, Gates and Microsoft took another risk. 
            They released the Microsoft Windows operating system. 
            This was Microsoft's answer to a similar operating system introduced 
            by Apple in 1984. 
            At first, many people complained that Microsoft Windows wasn't 
            as good as the Apple version. 
            However, Gates continued to press the open PC concept. 
            Microsoft Windows could run on a variety of PC compatible machines, 
            while the Apple operating system only ran on Apple machines. 
            Microsoft won the operating system battle and was soon installed on nearly 
            90% of the world's personal computers.<br><br>

            Gates wasn't satisfied with just winning the operating system portion 
            of the software market. 
            Over the next few years he introduced new products 
            such as Windows Office programs like Word and Excel. 
            The company also introduced new and improved versions of Windows.<br><br>

            In 1986, Gates took Microsoft public. 
            The company's stock was worth $520 million. 
            Gates owned 45 percent of the stock himself which was worth $234 million. 
            The company continued its rapid growth and the stock price soared. 
            At one point, Gates' stock was worth over $100 billion. 
            He was the richest man in the world.<br><br>

            <h3>Why was Bill Gates successful?</h3><br>
            Like most successful entrepreneurs, 
            Bill Gates' success came from a combination of hard work, intelligence, 
            timing, business sense, and luck. Gates constantly challenged 
            his employees to work harder and innovate, 
            but he also worked as hard or harder than the people who worked for him. 
            Gates also wasn't afraid to take risks. 
            He took a risk when he dropped out of Harvard to start his own company. 
            He also took a risk when he changed Microsoft's operating system 
            from MS-DOS to Windows. However, his risks were calculated. 
            He had confidence in himself and his product.<br><br>
